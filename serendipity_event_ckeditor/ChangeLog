-----
    * Some tweaks to en, de lang files.
    * Fixed force_install to set new values to database config table.
    * Fixed Spartacus upgrade 'plugin_to_conf' again, by using 'external_plugin' hook, 
      which now forces a real HTTP request and falls down to plugins instance config.
      The previous (2.3.2) 'install_plugin' did do, but created another plugin instance.
      If you were hit by this, please just purge other ckeditor instances in your plugin list.
      To push to "all" upgraders, the zip version num was bumped to force a deflate.

      [PLEASE NOTE: For Upgraders coming from 2.3.1 and earlier, the upgrade zip effect 
       may possibly happen on next future upgrade only, thus force the zip upgrade by the
       new 'force_install' emergency option, if not happen automatically.]

      which is easier than purge/install routines on zip upgrade failures

      procurator placeholder, to exclude from being touched by ACF

         cke_plugin.js - the render and add button/plugin file, which loads the custom config file and now renders all backend textareas.
    * To take care about placed javascript, smarty tags and other protected source tags (like 'mediainsert' by imageselectorplus galleries), 
         the new 'procurator' CKEDITOR Plugin (s9y-specific) was added, which acts like a hidden event plugin 
         and takes care for the placeholder wysiwyg-mode replacements.
    * In order to be able to place prettified code snippets into entries, the 
         'pbckcode' CKEDITOR Plugin was added (v 1.1.0, https://github.com/prbaron/PBCKCode).
