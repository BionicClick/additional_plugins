Gadu-Gadu Status

This little plugin displays in the sidebar a status in an icon form and its description
for a given Gadu-Gadu user. Gadu-Gadu is the most common (although not the _best_ one) 
Polish instant messenger.

To get this thing working, you need a new GG account, as a gateway. In the plugin 
configuration you set an UIN and its password, and set what UIN it should watch 
(for the most of times it will be your own UIN).

In the side-bar there will be displayed your watched UIN number, an icon depicting your status 
(available, busy, unavailable) and a text description. If the text description will be null, 
it will display "No description" text. If you want, you can edit your language file and put there 
an empty string. Probably I'll add an option if this specific text is to be displayed.

Have fun! :-)
