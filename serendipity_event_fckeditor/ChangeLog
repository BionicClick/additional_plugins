0.8:
- Changed download URL to sourceforge.net, since fckeditor.com is now ckeditor.com 
  and has no available downloads for this (old) FCKeditor plugin.
  The new rewritten CKeditor package is now supported within the new serendipity_event_ckeditor plugin.
- Fixed bug with default path setting in config (missing global $serendipity and unsupported WinOS path).
  

0.6: Add escaping of path, thanks to Stefan Schurtz (not really 'exploitable', but not nice also)
