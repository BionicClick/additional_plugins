WARNING: This version is heavily patched in Server.php to support system.multicall!
So it is not that easy to update to a newer PEAR version anymore. 
But as this patched version is based on the last 1.x version existing
this should not be needed.

-----------------------
OLD:
- Remove: 
RPC.php:
include_once 'PEAR.php'

RPC/Server.php:
require_once 'RPC/RPC.php';

if (!class_exists('XML_RPC_Base')) {
    require_once dirname(__FILE__) . '/../RPC.php';
}
