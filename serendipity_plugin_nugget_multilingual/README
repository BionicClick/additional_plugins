Serendipity 'Language-Specific HTML Nugget' Plug-in
by Wesley Hwang-Chung, version 1.1

This plug-in acts exactly like the default HTML Nugget plug-in,
with one exception - you can choose under what language the HTML
nugget will be visible in. For example, if you choose 'Korean',
the HTML nugget will be visible only if the blog is being viewed
under 'Korean' language option (generally using the Multilingual
plug-in).

This plug-in is useful in multilingual blogs where the author
wants to display different HTML nuggets specifically tied to a
language.
