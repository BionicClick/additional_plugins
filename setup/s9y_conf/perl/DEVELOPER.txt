These notes are intended to assist others in developing the script to provide
extra functionality, and convert it for use on alternative platforms.

Initial development of the script took place in a Linux environment, and it is
therefore likely to contain commands and features which may not work on other
platforms (e.g. Windows).

Files making up the complete package are spread across a directory hierarchy, and
generally contain only one subroutine.

=================================================================================

In order to convert this script for Windows usage you will need to resolve any
issues surrounding functions as described below, amongst others.

1. The command system('clear') is used to clear the terminal screen in menus and
   elsewhere.

2. The commands chmod and chown are used in the file output routines.

3. Sudo functionality is provided through system('') calls that contain the sudo
   command prefix.

4. The path/name of the datafile used to store data between runs is set in
   ./include/data/init_vars.pl, which includes '/'.

5. Login UID/GID and superuser information is collected in
   ./include/data/init_vars.pl using PERL '$' variables and the getpwuid()
   command.

6. Default data is set in ./include/data/init_data.pl, such as path names with
   '/'.

7. Data is also set in ./include/data/check_globals.pl, such as path names with
   '/'.

There will almost certainly be other issues that could affect the script
operation on a Windows platform, these are the ones I know may make/break the
script.
